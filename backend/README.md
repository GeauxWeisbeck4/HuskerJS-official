# Welcome to the backend of my blogging platform HuskerJS.dev

Here is where we will build out the APIs and their routes first on the local level. 
We'll hook it up to Strapi and get some APIs rolling and on the market. Going to 
try some gambling APIs today during the football games and see how much 
return they could possibly bring if you made your own. 

- [] Setup GitHub Repo and keep making starters
- [] Tweet Streams onto MongoDB type shit w/ Redis
- [] Make a huge-ass PostgreSQL server to store all this college football information
- [] Cash these with Redis, Algolia, and use on Twilio, Social Media platforms and 
stream them into real time and make APIs out of them you can call and make super gambling
robots. LMFAO
- [] Write about the sickest college football shit you can do with Web Development and 
especially shit that you can do on Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- [] Flask and Django for my API businesses. I'm going to make a microblogger w/ Flask 
for a different school I think. Start making different builds with different colleges.
- [] Microsoft: Write Power Shell scripts to automate these through Azure builds. Build 
it into native as well in process
- [] Mac: Try to get my desktop back because I really need it for coding. That is the best
computer I have and it is stuck at a fuckin pawn shop. I need to raise enough money to 
get that back as soon as possible.
