## La Lah La La Lah... Oh shit.. Football Game?

Yep, you have to get up. Get the fuck up out of bed! NOPE! You don't get to sleep through this one mother fucker. You have to bare your naked eyes to this abonishment they call Husker Football!

## Our Best Chance For a Win So Far This Season

So I can't help but be excited knowing that we have our best opportunity at picking up our first win of the season right here on this one. That's something worth noting, right? I'm just looking for positives here man, come the fuck on.

## PLEASE NO! FUCK NO

Just because I didn't review it or watch highlights, I'm making you do that right now just in case you tried to skip out on rewatching that game at all:

## Had enough yet?

Last week didn't feel like dragging your nutsack across rusty nails? What if I told you that there could be a cold steel thor hammer to smash them and finish them off this week... that hammer's name is NORTH DAKOTA!

#### No, No - this North Dakota...

Yes the shitty, North Dakota. Thank God.

I don't know if I could handle an upset from a FCS school right now. It would be like taking a rusty nail and embedding it into my skull. Those migraines... that's what a Saturday with Husker football is like. 

I'm getting all sorts of side tracked here and can't really focus on the game. Why? What's the point? Yeah, we'll probably steam roll them - but would you be surprised or really care if Nebraska blows this one too?

## Saturday's Matchup and Prediction

<a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-football-scott-frost-huskers-north-dakota/41055973">Frost says Huskers are confident, ready to 'prove it' against North Dakota</a>

HAHAHA PROVE WHAT? Ok, I get it - you want us to forget about week zero, at least long enough to pack your bags for Oct 4th when the buyout cuts in half. 

I predict Nebraska rolls in this one, but still lets up a bajillion yards of offense to an anemic North Dakota team who finished 8th in the Missouri Valey Conference last year.
